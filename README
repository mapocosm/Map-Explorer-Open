Introduction and licensing
--------------------------
Map Explorer is a mobile app for exploring custom maps, i.e. those that are 
not available from the standard Google "Maps" mobile app. Many websites and 
tools that produce KML files, including Google My Places, can be used to 
create custom maps that can be explored and shared with Map Explorer.

In addition to supporting maps, Map Explorer Open presents about 4k lines of
commerical-quality Javascript that can be used as the source code foundation 
for a wide variety of applications. Some of the principles embodied include:
 * Javascript modular CommonJS design, memory management, and style sheets
 * cross-platform UI with title bar, menu pulldown, and various dialogs
 * http file download queueing and management
 * query to REST web services and JSON response handling
 * XML file parsing
 * Android intent filters and invoking external apps
 * integrated web browser and image viewer objects
 * communication between web objects and javascript program
 * wide range of string handling, checksums, html decoding, ...
 * application setting parameters and persistence 
 * location-based services
 * web searching and formatting html results

Building and distributing apps
------------------------------
Map Explorer Open is written in Javascript using Appcelerator Titanium. 
http://www.appcelerator.com/

!! If you intend to build and distribute commercial applications based on this
open source code, YOU MUST change these application-specific parameters:
name, id, publisher, appid, guid, appname. These are found in the files
tiapp.xml, manifest, and AndroidManifest.xml.

The file app.js is the main program and has key architectural notes. To build 
and modify Map Explorer Open, you should create a new Titanium Mobile Project 
in Titanium Studio, which will provide a new unique app GUID, then transfer 
the source code files and merge tiapp.xml and AndroidManifest.xml values.

In order to build an app that allows web searching and location services, the
Googleness.js module must be updated for your vendor-specific Google API keys.
When ready to sign a production app for distribution, a vendor-specific Google 
Maps API key in file tiapp.xml must be updated. See Googleness.js for details.


Platforms: Tested on Android; adapting for iOS
----------------------------------------------
Map Explorer Open has been built and tested with Google Android 2.2, 2.3,
and 4.0. The source code is highly portable to Apple iPhone and iPad devices 
but must be adapted and tested for iOS. Some settings in tiapp.xml (such as 
<target>) must be updated for iOS; also see the Android/iOS notes in app.js.
